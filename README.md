# MusicRacer
[PROJECT IN PROGRESS/ NOT COMPLETE] MusicRacer is a procedurally generated rhythm game. The games places the player in a world where they must collect as many cubes (that represent musical beats) as possible. This game appeals to both competitive audiences and players that wish to immerse themselves in their favourite music.
